# QOSF Cohort 10 Screening Tasks

This repository contains solutions to all the screening tasks provided by the QOSF Quantum Computing Mentorship Program.

Each task has its own directory with a Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis, along with generated plots for visual reference.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Statevector Simulation of Quantum Circuits

In this task, I implemented a statevector simulator for quantum circuits from scratch.

### Task 2: Noise, Noise, and More Noise

This task involved creating a noise model to simulate realistic quantum noise and assess its impact on a quantum circuit.

### Task 3: Optimization - Bin Packing Problem

For this task, I solved the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) using quantum computing methods, converting it from an ILP to a QUBO formulation. I implemented various solvers, including brute force, quantum annealing, variational quantum circuits, and QAOA.

### Task 4: Decomposition

This task focused on reducing the complexity of quantum circuits by decomposing them into a specific set of basis gates and optimizing for circuit depth while preserving fidelity.
